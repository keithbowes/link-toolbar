# link-toolbar
A WebExtensions addon implementing [the LINK element](https://gutfeldt.ch/matthias/translation/LINK/ENaddendum.html). There was the [Link Widgets](https://web.archive.org/web/20181102194011/https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/link-widgets/) XUL extension for Firefox but it seems not to have been ported to WebExtensions.
